# Media Shop
An e-commerce website I created using Spring Boot, Angular and MySQL database.
## Motivation
Intrigued by web development, I wanted to try to create an interface that implemented a Spring Boot backend to emulate a website like Amazon where you can click 'Add to Basket' and a mini-basket in the corner will update automatically.
## How it looks and works
